- Run ppo.py to train the masknet. 
- The trained pong agent model is saved as `./ppo_test/baseline/Pong-v0_+0.896_12150.da`. ppo.py will automatically load this model to train the masknet.
- We give one trained masknet model in `./ppo_test/checkpoints/Pong-v0_+0.855_19700.dat`. It can be used to calculate the fidelity test score or loaded as a pretrained masknet model (set `TRANSFER_LEARNING=True` in `ppo.py`).
