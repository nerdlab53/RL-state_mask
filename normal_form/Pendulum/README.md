# Environment

Please install the gym environment before executing any program. We use the `Pendulum-v0` environment for our experiment.

# Code Structure 

We provide a pre-trained target agent in `./baseline/Pendulum-v0.zip` folder.

- `main.py`: main script to train a mask network.
- `ppo_lasso.py`: implement the network of masknet and the update algorithm.
- `test.py`: test the target agent's performance and the masknet's performance.
- `select_critical_steps.py`: select critical steps based on explanation.
- `replay.py`: replay the trajectories and replace the actions in the selected criticap steps with random actions.
- `random_replace.py`: randomly select critical steps and replace the actions in the selected criticap steps with random actions.
- `fidelity_score.py`: calculate the fidelity score.
- `visualize.py`: visualize a trajectory.
- `attack.py`: launch adversarial attacks based on explanation.

# StateMask

- Run `main.py` to train the masknet. We give one trained masknet model in `./tmp/ppo/`. It can be used to calculate the fidelity test score or loaded as a pre-trained masknet model.
- Run `test.py` to test the performance of the target agent and the masknet.
- To do fidelity tests, execute the following programs:
- - `python test.py` to generate trajectories for explanation
  - `python select_critical_steps.py ` to select most important time steps
  - `python replay.py` to randomize actions in the identified critical steps
  - `python fidelity_score.py` to calculate the fidelity score.
- We provide the code for applications such as attack in `attack.py`.
